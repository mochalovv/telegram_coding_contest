### Intro
This project took part in the Telegram Contest in March, 2019.

### Initial Task
https://t.me/contest/6 :
> The goal is to develop software for showing simple charts based on input data we provide. You can use either JavaScript, Android Java or iOS Swift.
>
> **Note**: you may not use specialized charting libraries. All the code you submit must be written by you from scratch.
>
> The criteria weâ€™ll be using to define the winner are speed, efficiency and the size of the app.
>
> The app should show 4 charts on one screen, based on the input data we will provide.

### Result
* The app won the 3rd prize on the contest! B)
* The size of the submitted apk is 38011 bytes. 
* The app uses Android Framework libarary only. `Build.gradle` file has no dependencies at all.
* The app satisfies the Android preferred requirement of having [60 fps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaMTIgxCSqU) when performing animations.

#### Feedback from Judges:
> Fast app, working smoothly even on older devices. Unfortunately, it doesn't fully comply with the design guidelines provided for the contest.

### To Sum Up
I'd like to thank Telegram for organizing such great contests. They allow developers to show off their coding skills as well as to acquire knowledge in areas which might be new for them.
