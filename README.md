### Intro
This project took part in Telegram Contest in March, 2019.

### Initial Task
https://t.me/contest/6 :
> The goal is to develop software for showing simple charts based on input data we provide. You can use either JavaScript, Android Java or iOS Swift.
> **Note**: you may not use specialized charting libraries. All the code you submit must be written by you from scratch.
> The criteria weâ€™ll be using to define the winner are speed, efficiency and the size of the app.
> The app should show 4 charts on one screen, based on the input data we will provide.
